* Curry-On Theme for Emacs
** Overview
I got inspired (read, blatantly stole) the main colors for this theme from a
talk I saw from a past [[www.curry-on.org/2019/][/Curry On!/ conference]]. Some of the original colors I
picked up from the talk's video didn't work so well (e.g., the teal I tried to
use for green was not really readable), and the foreground color was a bit too
contrasty, so I tweaked them a bit.

I tried to keep it clean for coding, without too much noise.

There is also a set of =urxvt= colors defined in the [[dotXdefaults]] file, which
can be used to make =urxvt= match this theme. 

#+NAME: fig:palette
